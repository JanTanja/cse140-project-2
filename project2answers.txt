Project 2 Answers to Questions

1. a. The ratio of hits to misses 48:16 -- 3 hits for every miss.
   b. 3:1 hits.
   c. 47 hits to 17 misses
   d. Same as c. The fully associative has the same hit to miss ratio as the direct-mapped cache
   e. The results are not surprising because the array is stored in contiguous memory, and
      thus a fully associative cache cannot be utilized entirely. 

2. A write-back cache will indicate a block as dirty when the cache is modified and memory is unchanged. 
   On the other hand, a write-through cache will immediately change new data from cache to memory. 
   
   A write-back is preferable over write-through when doing writes because 
   we don’t always have to access memory for each write, and there would be a lot of overhead.
   A write-through is preferable over write-back when we are reading because 
   we don’t always have to access memory constantly, and overhead would also be prominent.

3. A 2-way set associative cache will outperform a fully-associate cache when cache size is small. 
   There is lower latency for each access in a 2-way cache.
   Rather, a fully associative cache will be more appropriate in most other situations.

4. l2 cache is called every time there is a L1 hit. 
   If there is a L1 cache miss, we correspondingly check L2 for a hit. In the event that there is one, we commit 
   L1 cache. 

5. The input to accessMemory() might include more ways to access the virtual memory such as another table,
   however the output of the cache contents will still be the same.
